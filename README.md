# Basic-CF-Algorithm

Here is the implementation of a basic user-based collaborative filtering algorithm.

  -<b>knn.m</b> includes the codes retrieving most similar k users.
  
  -<b>zscoreweights.m</b> finds out similarity weights bw active user and a set of users.
  
  -<b>zscoreNormalization.m</b> transforms a dataset into z-score normalized one.
  
  -<b>userbasedMemoryCF.m</b> includes the main user based CF algorithm.
  
  -<b>maeRMSE.m</b> is the implementation of the evaluation metrics.
  
  -<b>PureUserBasedCf.m</b> is the test scenario.

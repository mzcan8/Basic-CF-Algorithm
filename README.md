# Basic-CF-Algorithm

Here is the implementation of a basic user-based collaborative filtering algorithm.

  -knn.m includes the codes retrieving most similar k users.
  -zscoreweights.m finds out similarity weights bw active user and a set of users.
  -zscoreNormalization.m transforms a dataset into z-score normalized one.
  -userbasedMemoryCF.m includes the main user based CF algorithm.
  -maeRMSE.m is the implementation of the evaluation metrics.
  -PureUserBasedCf.m is the test scenario.
